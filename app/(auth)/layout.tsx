The application integrates voice and conversational AI via WebRTC and Vapi workflows, ensuring an interactive and immersive experience. Building such a system required seamlessly connecting multiple services: managing authentication and user data with Firebase, leveraging Gemini AI for dynamic question generation and feedback, and integrating Vapi for voice-based interview simulations. The result is a streamlined, professional platform that empowers users to prepare for interviews with greater confidence and realism.",
